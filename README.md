# Simple Mobile Post Processing for Unity
Idea of this project is that I was bored of standard post processing stack for unity which is unoptimized for mobile devices (applying simple vingette effect adds 6ms in frame time, wholescreen blur is destroying framerate totally) To solve this I created this simple post processing which currently only offers two post processing effect:
- **Whole Screen Blur** - you can control blur radius and texture resoulution scale
- **Vignette** - you can control effect intensity and center of vignette
